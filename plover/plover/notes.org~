* Notes
- some good prefixes for addional pluins
  - #TWH (trevor-mouse)
  - #STH
  - SKPW
- Norvig has file of english word freqency
** laying out steno keyboard (mainly ward stone ireland)
  the number of keys required is dependant on how many
  sounds are needed in the language. with ward stone ireland
  the keyboard is split into onset, nucleus, coda
  - there are ~70 onset (per wikipedia) so we need 2^7 = 128
    keys since 2^6 is only 64 which is too few.
    and look we have 7 keys on left hand in WSI STKPWHR
  - there are ~16 vowels in general american and 2^4 is about 16
    some vowels are merged in many theories
    - like KAT being cat in lapwing when it is actual /kæt/
      so ɑ and æ are the same
      - pheonix seems to replace a lot of these with ə so pheonix
        probably fixes a lot of these types of issues
  - There are ~120 codas (discord says so). so 8 keys
  - The letter on left and right hand sides 

  
* trevor-mouse
moving the mouse in steno. uses #TWH as the starter chord
and then right hand bottom row gives the vim movements.
can change the distance moved by using the right thumb cluster.

- [ ] make this modal. atleast make it that right hand chord
  doesn't have to be used everytime
- [ ] make double modal and have thumb cluster set speed once and
  not everytime

* trevor-numbers
able to print the numbers from 0-1023 in one stroke
everything is done in binary
-S -> +1
-G -> +2
-B -> +4
...

the pattern begins on S and goes to the left until R
and then goes up a row and finally goes to the right
hand thumb keys.

this makes it the same as emily modifiers but with an
extra row stacked above and the thumbs as well

without the thumbs we can only go to 255 so adding thumbs
quadruples that and gets us to 1023

some ideas are
- writing out the numbers when a thumb key is hit
 ex: 10 -> "ten"
- adding commas to words
  ex:  1004 -> "1,004"
- supress spaces

* Modifications
 - added abby left hand fingerspelling to emily modifiers
 - made trevor-numbers which can write out 0-1023 in one stroke
 - 


* TODO
 - [ ] use abby fingerspelling in all dictionaries
   - lapwing already has this
   - modified emily modifers
 - [X] use a consistant numbering system (trying binary)
 - [ ] add more options for trevor-numbers for groupings
 - [ ] modify lapwing modal movement to be vim like
 - [ ] find a nice way to uncaptialize lapwing names
 - [ ] mouse stuff
 - [ ] rpn
 - [ ] learn how to change case of text
 - [ ] make a more friendly emacs way of entering commands



 
* ideas
** treat suffixes and prefixes the same
in lapwing you can add a suffix to a word HELP/*ER to get helper
but one has to add de before typing the root of the word.
it might be fun to type a prefix after the base of the word.
** finding a way to see if one key can have many outputs
wsi layout basically has the minimum amount of keys to output
all of english sounds. we might be able to use less keys if there
are combinations which cannot exist, and we override that combination
with something that is still useful. this is probably really hard
without a lot of phonotactics. brute force might work as well
 
* research
- lexicon
  - list of stems and affixes
  - [ ] find this and get it in prolog
- morphotactics
  - which morphemes can follow other morphemes
  - can use this to find out which sounds are uncommon and reserve
    for briefs or clearing ambuguities
- phonotactics
  what phonetics can follow another to make a phoneme
- orthographic rules
  - y -> ie stuff
    these don't seems useful if we have a dictionary since we will just
    match on those. tho we need to find those which this will be good for
- inflectional morphemes
- verb forms



* ideas from other theories
** magnum
- found some quizlet decks at https://quizlet.com/518531750/magnum-steno-beginning-theory-chapter-1-2-flash-cards/?funnelUUID=30379664-be5d-44cc-b216-8cac71255028
- 


* autobriefer stuff
Harri's autobriefer look quite cool. it would save the issue
of generating a good intermediate representation. so this can
be used on lapwing to make it shorter, and more like joshiah.
seems like the easiest approch and best approch because i seem
to like lapwing's vowels.
** R* or *R -> re- (josiah)
- lapwing does a two stroke with REU
- adding this turns replace from REU/PHRAEUS to PHRAEURS
